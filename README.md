As we move forward in our class, we are going to be working more and more in collaborative groups for projects, labs, and assignments. These group coding sessions are ways to prepare you for working in the field, when doing paired programming and working with very different people from different areas, time zones, and in some cases, countries and continents! Our goal is to give you the experience of working with these people in both asking for, and providing help and resources. To help guide you in this professional development path, there are a few peices of ettiquite and norms that we want to begin working with.


You can expect your management, team leaders, coworkers, and investors to have a strict, Zero Tolerance policy on any rude, disrespectful, or unprofessional actions. So we are going to follow the same guidelines in preparation.

And whether it is with Wireframe designs & Figma, group planning & Trello, and the building up of Component Heirarchy Diagrams for React, and Entity Relation Diagrams for your Backend, wireframing and pseudocoding to plan out your first stems, seeing how important it is to put yourselves on the same page, and use our adjacent skills and technologies to streamline and help aid in our process.


You will learn, the most important part of the collaborative coding process is Communication. With your teammates, and with your instructors, we want to know what you are expecting while we are in these group work sessions. The best thing you can do is share any relevent information with us; keeping quiet and not talking about anything you can forsee is only going to cause more problems down the road

## Work / Life Balance :


We understand that people in this class have responsibilities as parents, partners, and everything else in life. It is **Okay** to speak to your group about these responsibilities and and time needed for them (dropping off/picking up kids from school, appointments, walking your dog, etc). It is **Not Okay** to prevent / guilt your team mates away from any of these responsbilities, and to not tell your team about them before taking time out for them.

The important thing is **Balance** and making sure that you keep this class as your priority, while not hindering the other parts of your life.

*You will not be penalized if you need to take an hour off one night to go to the dentist, you will be if you forget to tell your group that you'll be taking 3 days off for a Booze Cruise in the Caribbean.*

## Responsibilities and Tasks

One of the most important parts of collaborative group work is taking on responsibilities that you can accomplish. You will not gain any bonus points for the project by taking on more parts than you can accomplish, especially if you come to your team last minute and need them to pick up your Slack. We want you to pick tasks that will challenge you that you will learn from, but not too much to overwhelm you that you will not be able to complete your task, and learn from this.

We want you to use Trello to your advantage so your group knows what each member's tasks and deadlines will be for them, and can help each other through them.

The goal of our group activities is to have each member of your group contribute and learn. We do not want one person to be carrying the entirety of the group. It isn't fair to them, and it does not create an optimal learning experience for each other member

Again, the most important part of this is going to be *balance* in your work. It is Okay to be a bit behind on one task, especially if it is a difficult one. It is **not** okay to castigate or belittle any of your team mates if they have trouble accomplishing a task. However, it is crucial to be open with your team about your challenges with each task - if we see that any team mate has missed a due date for more than 2 of your individual tasks, your instructors will have to intervene, to measure what the contributions will be for credit to be recieved.
