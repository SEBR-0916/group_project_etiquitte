# Group Project Etiquitte

- As we move forward in our class, we are going to be working more and more in collaborative groups for projects, labs, and assignments. These group coding sessions are ways to prepare you for working in the field, when paired programming and working with different people from different areas, time zones, and in some cases, countries and continents is going to be an every day experience. 

- You **don't** have to love every single member of your team. Your squad does **not** need to be your best friends. What matters most is treating them respectfully, professionally, and being able to work with them, both asking for, and providing, help & assistance when needed.
  
- Our goal is to give you the experience of working with other people, and building up the collaborative and professional skills that will make you a star on your team. To help guide you in this professional development path, there are a few peices of etiquitte and norms that we want to begin working with.

- You will quickly learn, the most important part of the collaborative coding process is Communication. With your teammates, and with your instructors, we want to know what you are expecting while we are in these group work sessions. The best thing you can do is share any relevent information with us; keeping quiet and not talking about anything you can forsee is only going to cause more problems down the road!

## Planning

- Whether it is with Wireframe designs & Figma, group planning & Trello, the building up of Component Heirarchy Diagrams for React, Entity Relation Diagrams for your Backend, wireframing and pseudocoding to plan out your first steps, it is absolutely crucial to take the initial planning steps seriously, to put your team on the same page
  
- Your team should complete each step of planning - from  Models and Data to Style and Design - before any code is written, that way all members know their task and will work together. Writing out any serious blocks of code before this step can cause issues between the team, and while it might seem like a way to get ahead on a few steps, there is a strong possibility that it will need to be rewritten or deleted, and will not be time well spent

- The goal of ERD's, Wireframes, Component Diagrams, & other planning steps is to discuss your ideas and have constructive criticism and feedback. "This is an interesting idea, is there a reason we aren't doing *this* instead?" is a fair thing to say to a group. "This is stupid and a bad idea" is not. 

## Work / Life Balance :

- We understand that people in this class have responsibilities as parents, partners, and everything else in life. It is **Okay** to speak to your group about these responsibilities and and time needed for them (dropping off/picking up kids from school, appointments, walking your dog, etc). It is **Not Okay** to prevent / guilt your team mates away from any of these responsbilities, and to not tell your team about them before taking time out for them.

- We do not want anyone to overstep their bounds and cause undue stress for your group. These are meant to be learning experiences for you and your peers. If we hear of any group member acting out of line to another, your instructional team may need to intervene.

- The important thing is **Balance** and making sure that you keep this class as your priority, while not hindering the other parts of your life.

- *You will not be penalized if you need to take an hour off one night to go to the dentist, you will be if you forget to tell your group that you'll be taking 3 days off for a Booze Cruise in the Caribbean.*



## Responsibilities and Tasks

- One of the most important parts of collaborative group work is taking on responsibilities that you can accomplish. You will *not* gain any bonus points for the project by taking on more parts than you can accomplish, especially if you come to your team last minute and need them to pick up your Slack. We want you to pick tasks that will challenge you that you will learn from, but not too much to overwhelm you that you will not be able to complete your task, and learn from this.

- Use Trello to your advantage so your group knows what each member's tasks and deadlines will be for them, and can help each other through them.

- The goal of our group activities is to have each member of your group contribute and learn. We do not want one person to be carrying the entirety of the group. It isn't fair to them, and it does not create an optimal learning experience for each other member

- It is Okay to be a bit behind on one task, especially if it is a difficult one. It is **not** okay to castigate or belittle any of your team mates if they have trouble accomplishing a task. However, it is crucial to be open with your team about your challenges with each task - if we see that any team mate has missed a due date for more than 2 of your individual tasks, your instructors will have to intervene, to measure what the contributions will be for credit to be recieved. 

## Respect and Professionalism

- It is preferred to have your camera on while group mates are speaking to each other. You obviously may not need to have your camera on all the time you are together in a breakout room, but when speaking to each other it is considered better practice to have your camera on. Of course, it is fully acceptable to tell the team if you need to have it off for any reason for some time. You can expect managers, admin, team leaders and employers to want you to have your camera on during any professional meetings, so get in the habit of having it on, rather than keeping it off

- You can expect your management, team leaders, coworkers, and investors to have a strict, Zero Tolerance policy on any rude, disrespectful, or unprofessional actions. So we are going to follow the same guidelines in preparation.

- Treat each project in the class as you would a task in the workspace. It is okay to disagree about certain parts of code (Flex vs Grid? Hexcodes vs RGBA?), but make sure you allow each group member to speak about their opinions and *Why* they want to work in a certain way.

- **Do Not** include anything that is culturally insensitive or offensive into any part of your project. You may think that edgy memes are funny: your teammates and managers may not. Keep them to yourself. 5 seconds of *lolz* is not worth potentially being fired, canned, sacked, or removed from the program

- If we hear about people overwriting and deleting other member's contributions, stonewalling against another group member's ideas, or the use of any unprofessional, disrespectful, or other rude language or actions during this project, it will qualify as a Code of Conduct issue, and your instructional team will need to act accordingly


## Plagiarism

- Plagiarism in Group Projects is something we take seriously here at GA. While each case is different, know that if you are knowingly plagiarising your group, or if you are aware of a group member plagiarising major parts of the code, we may need to pursue some kind of action against an individual member, or the whole group.

- Your best move is to consult with your instructional team about anything you are concerned about to ensure that you and your group are all acting within GA's official Plagiarism guidelines


  ## Recap

- The most important part of Collaborative Group Work is going to be open and honest communication. If you are having difficulty with a task, if something serious has come up in your life, if you really feel that a part of the project could be improved by changing something, tell your group. Communication is a skill into itself - and can even be more difficult than writing the code itself!

  - Your instructors are on your side through this, as these group projects are a tremendous way to build up your skills for the workplace. If you have any additional questions, or would like any more guidance on this, do not hesitate to ask!
